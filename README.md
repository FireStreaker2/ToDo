# About
ToDo is a simple app made with [react native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [expo](https://expo.dev/).

# Usage
since im too poor to publish this app on an app store, you will have to [selfhost](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/ToDo#Selfhosting) it

> note that there is currently no demo link, because of hosting issues

# Selfhosting
If you would like to selfhost this, you may.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FireStreaker2/ToDo.git
$ cd ToDo
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

> Make sure you have the ``Expo Go`` app installed on your mobile device if you want to use it on mobile.
